# Social-Media-Advertising-Analysis

## Overview

This report investigates the effectiveness of social media advertising campaigns across Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and Twitter. Utilizing a dataset of approximately 300,000 campaigns from 50 companies over a year, the analysis focuses on understanding the relationships between key metrics like impressions, clicks, conversion rates, and ROI. The study aims to provide actionable insights for social media advertisers to optimize their strategies and maximize campaign performance.

## Objectives

* Analyze the correlation between impressions, clicks, conversion rates, and ROI.
* Compare advertising performance across different social media platforms.
* Evaluate the impact of targeted customer segmentation on advertising ROI.
* Develop predictive models to identify factors influencing conversion rates and ROI.
* Provide practical recommendations for social media advertisers to improve campaign effectiveness.

## Data

The dataset comprises approximately 300,000 social media advertising campaigns conducted across Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and Twitter over a one-year period in 2022. It includes the following variables:

* **Target Audience:** Detailed demographic targeting information (e.g., Men 25-34).
* **Customer Location:** Geographic location of the targeted audience.
* **Language:** Language preferences of the targeted audience.
* **Industry:** Industry sector of the advertised products or services.
* **Platform:** Social media platform used for advertising (Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter).
* **Duration:** Length of the advertising campaign.
* **Conversion Rate:** Percentage of users who completed a desired action.
* **ROI (Return on Investment):** Financial return generated by the advertising campaign.

A sample of the dataset will be posted on GitHub

Data cleaning involved handling missing data and transforming the "Target Audience" variable into separate "Gender" and "Age" variables for more granular analysis.

## Key Findings

### Correlation Analysis

* A strong positive correlation (0.94) exists between impressions and clicks, indicating that higher impressions lead to more clicks.
* Conversion rates show a moderate positive correlation with impressions and clicks.
* Campaign duration has a weak correlation with impressions, clicks, conversion rates, and ROI.
* ROI has a weak correlation with impressions, clicks, and conversion rates, suggesting other factors significantly influence ROI.

### Platform Performance

* Facebook and Twitter have the highest impressions and click volumes.
* Instagram has the highest conversion rates.
* Facebook and Instagram demonstrate the highest ROI.
* Pinterest consistently underperforms across all metrics.

### Customer Segmentation

* **Gender:** Women show slightly higher conversion rates, and ROI is nuanced across genders.
* **Age:** Younger audiences (18-24) have the highest conversion rates, while mid-age audiences (35-44) show the highest ROI.
* **Language:** Conversion rates and ROI are consistent across English, French, and Spanish languages.
* **Location:** Conversion rates vary significantly by location, but ROI remains relatively stable.
* **Industry:** The Health and Technology industries have the highest conversion rates and ROI.

### Predictive Modeling

* **Conversion Rates:**
    * Younger age groups, specific locations (Los Angeles, New York), Health and Technology industries, Instagram and Pinterest platforms, and longer campaign durations are associated with higher conversion rates.
    * Model R-squared: 0.5974
* **ROI:**
    * Older age groups, specific locations (San Francisco), the Technology industry, Instagram platform, longer campaign durations, higher conversion rates, more impressions, and fewer clicks are associated with higher ROI.
    * Model R-squared: 0.3525 (model predictive power is limited)

## Recommendations

* **Platform Selection:** Prioritize Instagram and Facebook for optimal performance.
* **Targeting:** Focus on younger audiences for higher conversion rates and tailor strategies to specific locations and industries.
* **Campaign Optimization:** Run longer campaigns, improve click quality, and optimize landing pages.
* **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly analyze campaign data, monitor competitive landscapes, and adapt to platform algorithm changes.
* **Further Exploration:** Investigate the impact of ad creative, granular targeting, and external factors on ROI.

## Deliverables

* A comprehensive report detailing the analysis of social media advertising data.
* Visualizations illustrating campaign performance across different platforms and audience segments.
* Predictive models for conversion rates and ROI, along with evaluation metrics.
* Actionable recommendations for optimizing social media advertising strategies.
* R code used for data analysis and modeling (available on GitHub).
